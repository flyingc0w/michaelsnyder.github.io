      <div id="about">
        <p class="ptitle">
          Ever since I've been a kid, programming has always sparked my interest.
          When I was around 15 years old I went to a camp and created a website over the summer. In high school, I took a web design course.
          Within the past few years I have been learning a bit on Codecademy, but the knowledge hasn't really stuck with the 6+ years between learning periods.
          I am a marketing graduate that went into corporate logistics/administration. Myself and many others were laid off from the company I used to work at.
          I wasn't the happiest at my job and I see the layoff as an opportunity to change and grow, especially since it came with some nice benefits.
